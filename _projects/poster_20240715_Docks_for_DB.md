In the ever-expanding field of biology, the wealth of available data presents both opportunities and challenges. As I delved into the realm of bioinformatics, I embarked on a journey to unlock the potential of vast biological datasets, ranging from genes and single cells to cellular and microbial landscapes. Leveraging my expertise in software development, I tried constructing and developing bioinformatics database systems that would enable data-driven investigations. This poster showcases my works in crafting and implementing innovative databases, including TeCD, CASA, FACdb on bioinformatics databases and an Earthquake Alert system, which is based on the RSIT algorithm and dynamic network biomarkers (DNB) methodology.
