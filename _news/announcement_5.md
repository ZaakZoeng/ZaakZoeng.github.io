I am deeply grateful to Professor Chen for providing this incredible opportunity. My sincere thanks go to Dr. Gao, Dr. Bai, and Researcher Yu for their insightful guidance on my research topic. A special thank you to Senior Brother Li Fei for his leadership and support. I also appreciate the collaboration and exchange with my colleagues, which has enriched my experience in hormone research. 🖥️ Together, we've created the first mouse multi-organ single-cell atlas, facilitating systematic studies on androgen function and gender differences. You can explore our work at（https://casadbtools.com. 🐭 🐹 We welcome colleagues and friends to visit, review, and provide feedback.

Since beginning my projects two years ago, I have been evolving from an engineering mindset to one focused on scientific problem-solving. Looking forward, I am excited to deepen my knowledge in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, aiming to develop intelligent methods that can help solve complex scientific questions.


感谢陈老师提供的机会，感谢高老师、白老师、于老师对课题的指导，特别感谢李飞师兄的带领和帮助，感谢其他小伙伴们的交流合作，让我有幸接触到激素课题的研究。🖥️ 其中，我们绘制了首张用于系统性研究雄激素功能和性别差异的小鼠多器官单细胞图谱（https://casadbtools.com）🐭 🐹，在这里也欢迎各位同行朋友访问浏览与批评指正。

从两年前接触项目开始至今，我也正在不断尝试从“以工程思维做项目”转向“以科学问题做课题”，以此为一个台阶，希望后面将会继续围绕单细胞转录组和空间转录组不断学习，争取做出有用的智能方法来解读部分科学问题。
